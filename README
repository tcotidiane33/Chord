```The provided code is a simple implementation of a Chord distributed hash table. It allows adding, reading, and removing data, as well as creating and dropping nodes. The code uses a `ChordAPI` class to interact with the Chord network.

            Here's a brief explanation of the code:

            1. The `initializeChord()` method initializes the Chord network by creating a specified number of nodes (`NUM_OF_NODES`). Each node is represented by a `ChordNode` object.

            2. The `handleCommand()` method processes user input commands. It supports the following commands:
            - `add`: Adds a key-value pair to a specified node.
                    - `read`: Reads the value associated with a specified key from a specified node.
            - `remove`: Removes a key-value pair from a specified node.
                    - `create`: Creates a new node in the Chord network.
            - `drop`: Drops a specified node from the Chord network.
            - `list`: Lists all nodes in the Chord network.
                    - `exit`: Stops the Chord network.

            3. The `main()` method initializes the Chord network, reads user input commands, and processes them using the `handleCommand()` method.

                    The code also includes a `BufferedReader` to read user input from the console. The `handleCommand()` method processes the input commands and performs the corresponding operations on the Chord network.

            To run the code, you need to compile and run the `ChordAPI` class. The `ChordAPI` class should be in the same directory as the `ChordNode` and `Hash` classes. The `ChordNode` and `Hash` classes are part of the Chord implementation and should be in the same directory as the `ChordAPI` class.

            Here's an example of how to run the code:

```bash
            javac ChordAPI.java
            java ChordAPI
